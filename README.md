# Fyle Frontent Challenge
The Fyle frontend challenge presented an exciting opportunity to showcase Angular expertise while leveraging the Github API to develop a dynamic Github profile viewer. Participants were tasked with forking and constructing an Angular project, then crafting a sleek interface to interact with Github's vast repository of user data.

**The challenge involved several key components:**

- Angular Project Setup: Participants were required to set up a clean Angular project, ensuring proper configuration and dependencies for seamless development.

- Github API Integration: Utilizing Angular's HttpClient module, contestants interfaced with the Github API to retrieve user profile data, repositories, and other relevant information.

- User Interface Design: Crafting an intuitive and visually appealing user interface was crucial. Contestants had the freedom to design elements such as user profile cards, repository lists, and navigation features to enhance user experience.

- Unit Testing: Emphasizing code quality and reliability, participants implemented unit tests using Angular's testing utilities. Testing components, services, and other modules ensured functionality remained consistent and bug-free.

- Code Coverage: As a measure of code quality and test coverage, contestants aimed to achieve high code coverage percentages. Employing tools like Karma and Jasmine, they analyzed and improved code coverage to ensure comprehensive testing across the application.

### Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
 
 Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
- npm: npm is bundled with Node.js. You can verify its installation by running npm -v.
- Angular cli: The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell.

 **Installation**
- Clone this repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git```
- Navigate to the project directory:
  ```cd your-project```
- Install project dependencies:
 ```npm install```

### Running the Project
- To run the project locally, use the following command:
`ng serve`

This will start the development server. 
Open your browser and visit **http://localhost:4200/** to view your Angular app.

### Testing
We use Jasmine for testing. To run tests, execute:
`ng test`
